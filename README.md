# blackcat
GMod CivilGamers MaxNet Hacking Script

Script Currently Doesn't Function. Please Wait For Update

# How to install:
Navigate to root directory using 'cd ..' command. The directory should be '/r>'

Create new directory called blackcat with the command 'file createdir blackcat'

Change into that directory using 'cd blackcat'

Create 3 new files;
blackcat.mscx
dcrypt.mscx
bcat.man

From the respository copy the files with their respetive names into these new files.

Once all files are copied you can now run blackcat.mscx using 'mnscript exec blackcat.mscx'

# Misc

I recommend you also remove hash_conceal.exe, bf_password.exe and spoof_address.exe from you r/programs directory as blackcat will automatically create these tools in a seperate directory for you.


bcat.man is not required to be installed however the 'bcat -h' command will not function
